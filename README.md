## 1-Scale and convert images using PIL
A company is in the process of updating their website, and they hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor delivered the final designs in the wrong format - rotated 90 degrees and too big. You can't call the designers and your deadline is fast approaching. I'll need to use Python to get these images ready to run.
#### I will do
Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:
- Open an image
- Rotate an image
- Resize an image
- Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory 


## 2-Process Text Files with Python Dictionaries and Upload to Running Web Service
I work for a company that sells used cars. This company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. My manager asks me to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on the company's website. To do this, I'll need to write a script to convert these .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, and then upload the data to the company's website.
#### I will do
- Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files 
- Manage information stored in Python dictionaries
- Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service
- Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods 


## 3-Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by Email
I working for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.
#### I will do
- Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
- Generate a PDF using Python
- Automatically send a PDF by email 


## 4-Automate updating catalog information
I work in an online fruit store, I needed to develop a system that updates catalog information with data provided by suppliers. Suppliers send the data as large images with a description associated with the products in two files (.tif for image and .txt for description). Images must be converted to smaller jpegs and text must be converted to an HTML file that displays the image and product description. The contents of the HTML file must be uploaded to a web service already running with Django. I also needed to collect the name and weight of all fruits from .txt files and use a Python request to upload it to the Django server.
I will create a Python script that processes images and descriptions and then update your company's website online to add the new products.
Once the task is completed, the supplier must be notified with an email indicating the total weight of the fruit (in pounds) loaded. The email should have a PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in pounds).
Finally, parallel to running the automation, we want to validate the system and send an email if something goes wrong.
#### I will do
- Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories 
- Generate a PDF using Python
- Automatically send a PDF by email 
- Write a script to check the health status of the system
